// Note: no inheritance from DatasetAP, because possible violation of Liskov substitution principle.
// Semantic differences: features might be transformed (f.e. with principle components analysis) and therefore
// be semantic different from recorded features.
// Possible violation: Usage of DatasetAFE instead of DatasetAP as input for feature extraction.
//      transforming already transformed features leads to missing traceability of whole pipeline used to create
//      dataset. Only one featureExtractorÂ´s trace-data is stored in this object.
